    <div class="transfer">
    Transferring designs from paper to textile through heat transfer is a popular and versatile method widely used in textile art and crafting. This technique involves printing or drawing designs onto special transfer paper and then applying heat using an iron or heat press to transfer the design onto the fabric.The process begins with creating or selecting a design to transfer onto the fabric. This design is then printed or drawn onto heat transfer paper using an inkjet or laser printer, depending on the type of transfer paper being used. It's important to print the design in reverse (mirror image) to ensure that it appears correctly when transferred onto the fabric.
    Once the design is printed onto the transfer paper, it is carefully positioned onto the fabric with the printed side facing down. The fabric and transfer paper are then sandwiched between the heated platen of a heat press or iron, and pressure is applied for a specified amount of time.
