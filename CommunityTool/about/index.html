     This is a quiz based on the Hindu Community Gods. The purpose of this quiz is to make other people aware about the true facts about this 
     community. Being an international students there are so many times when I see that people only see the Hindu festivals from a surface level whereas they have much more meaning to the people in the community. So I thought of making this quiz to tell people some interesting facts of the Hindu Community.
